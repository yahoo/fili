Fili API Guide
==================

The Fili API provides access to the underlying data that powers Fili.

All interaction with the API is via HTTPS `GET` requests, which means that your entire query is just a URL, making it
easy to save and share queries.

Core Concepts
-------------

There are 5 main concepts in the Fili API:

- [Dimensions](#dimensions)
- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tables](#tables)
- [Filters](#filters)
- [Time Grain](#time-grain)
- [Interval](#interval)

### Dimensions ###

Dimensions are the dimensions along which you can slice and dice the data. Dimensions can be used for grouping and
aggregating, as well as filtering of data, and are a critical part of the system. Each dimension has a set of available
fields, as well as a collection of possible values for that dimension. These dimension fields and values serve two
primary purposes: Filtering and Annotating data query results.

All dimensions have an Id property (a natural key) and a Description property (a human-readable description). Both of
these fields can be used to filter rows reported on, and both of these fields are included in the data query result set
for each dimension.

Get a [list of all dimensions](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions

Get a [specific dimension](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/productRegion):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/productRegion

Get a [list of possible values for a dimension](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values

Additionally, the values for a dimension have some options for querying them:

- [Pagination](#pagination--limit)
- [Format](#response-format)
- [Filtering](#filtering) (All filters are supported)

For example, to get the [2nd page of User Countries with U in the description, with 5 entries per page, in JSON format](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/userCountry/values?filters=userCountry|desc-contains[U]&page=2&perPage=5&format=json):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/dimensions/userCountry/values?filters=userCountry|desc-contains[U]&page=2&perPage=5&format=json

### Metrics ###

Metrics are the data points, and include things like Page Views, Daily Average Time Spent, etc. Since the metrics
available depend on the particular table and time grain, you can discover the available metrics by querying the table
you are interested in, as well as a metrics collection resource that lists all metrics supported by the system.

Get a [list of all metrics](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/metrics):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/metrics
    
Get a [specific metric](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/metrics/timeSpent):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/metrics/timeSpent

### Tables ###

Tables are the connecting point that tell you what combination of [Metrics](#metrics) and [Dimensions](#dimensions) are
available, and at what [time grain](#time-grain). For each table, and a specific time grain, there is a set of Metrics
and Dimensions that are available on that table.

Get a [list of all tables](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/tables):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/tables

Get a [specific table](https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/tables/network/week):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.org/v1/tables/network/week

### Filters ###

Filters allow you to constrain the data processed by the system. Depending on what resource is being requested, filters
may constrain the rows in the response, or may constrain the data that the system is processing. 

For non-Data resource requests, since there isn't any data aggregation happening, filters primarily exclude or include 
rows in the response.

For [Data resource](#data-queries) requests, however, filters primarily exclude or include raw data rows aggregated to
produce a result. In order for filters on the Data resource requests to constrain the _rows in the  response_, the 
request must have a [Dimension Breakout](#dimension-breakout) along the dimension being filtered.

### Interval ###

The Interval (or `dateTime`) of a data query is the date/time range for data to include in the query. The interval is 
expressed as a pair of start and stop instants in time, using the ISO 8601 format, where the start instant is inclusive 
and the end instant is exclusive. It sounds complicated, but it's pretty straight-forward once you get the hang of it.

One important thing to note about intervals is that they must align to the [time grain](#time-grain) specified in the
query. So, if you ask for monthly time grain, the interval must start and stop on month boundaries, and if you ask for 
weekly time grain, the interval must start and stop on a Monday, which is when our week starts and stops.

### Time Grain ###

Time grain is the granularity or "bucket size" of each response row. Or, to look at it another way, time grain is the
period over which metrics are aggregated. In particular, this matters a lot for metrics that are counting "unique" 
things, like Unique Identifier.

Defaulted granularities include second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year.  The all granularity aggregates all data into a single bucket. 

Data Queries
------------

Data queries are the meat of the Fili API. The data resource allows for:

- Grouping by [dimensions](#dimensions)
- Grouping by a [time grain](#time-grain)
- [Filtering](#filtering) by dimension values
- Performing [Having](#having) filters on metric values
- Selecting [metrics](#metrics)
- Reporting on a specific [interval](#interval) of time
- [Sorting](#sorting) by a metric within a time grain
- Selecting the [response format](#response-format)

### Basics ###

Let's start by looking at the URL format, using an example:

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08

This [basic query](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08)
gives us network-level page views and daily average time spent data for one week. Let's break down the different 
components of this URL.

- **https\://** - The Fili API is only available over a secure connection, so _HTTPS is required_. _HTTP queries
    will not work_.
- **sampleapp.fili.org** - This is where the Fili API lives.
- **v1** - The version of the API.
- **data** - This is the resource we are querying, and is the base for all data reports.
- **network** - Network is the [table](#tables) we are getting data from.
- **week** - The top-level reporting [time grain](#time-grain) of our results. Each row in our response will aggregate a
    week of data.
- **metrics** - The different [metrics](#metrics) we want included in our response, as a comma-separated list of
    metrics. (Note: these are case-sensitive)
- **dateTime** - Indicates the [interval](#interval) that we are running the report over, in
    [ISO 8601 format](#dates-and-times).

### Dimension Breakout ###

Great, we've got the basics! But, what if we want to add a dimension breakout? Perhaps [along the Product Region 
dimension](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08)?

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08

The only difference is that we've added an additional path segment to the URL (`productRegion`). All breakout dimensions
are added as path segments after the [time grain](#time-grain) path segment. To group by more [dimensions](#dimensions),
just add more path segments!

So, if we wanted to [also breakout by `gender`](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion/gender?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08) 
in addition to breaking out by `productRegion` (a 2-dimension breakout):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion/gender?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08

### Filtering Example ###

Now that we can group by dimensions, can we filter out data that we don't want? Perhaps we want to see [our global
numbers, but excluding the US data](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas+Region])?

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas Region]

We've now added a [filter](#filtering) to our query that excludes (`notin`) rows that have the `Americas Region` id for
the `productRegion` dimension. We also removed the `productRegion` grouping dimension we added earlier, since we wanted 
to see the global numbers, not the per-region numbers. 

This example also shows that we can filter by dimensions that we are not grouping on! Filters are very rich and
powerful, so take a look at the [Filters](#filtering) section for more details. Oh, and one last thing about filters on
the Data resource: By default `in`, `notin`, `eq`, `startswith`, and `contains` are supported, but `startswith` and `contains` may be disabled.

### Response Format Example ###

Now, the very last thing we need from our report: We need it [in CSV format](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas Region]&format=csv),
so that we can pull it into Excel and play around with it! No worries, the Fili API supports CSV!

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas Region]&format=csv

For additional information about response format, take a look at the [Format](#response-format) section!

Table Queries
------------

### Table Availability ###
Availability for a table(logical table) is defined as the maximal set of intervals that the table may be able to respond
to. Or put another way, the table can certainly not respond to any intervals beyond the range marked available. 

### Constrained Queries ###
Constrained availability will be defined as the availability for a table given a set of query constraints. 

Currently the tables/table/timeGrain response lacks an indication of the time range(s) for which the table has data
(ie. can answer questions), but implementation is going on to expand the table resource so that it can take pretty much
the same inputs that the data resource takes, and would use those inputs to constrain / restrict the available time
ranges (and even available schema, etc.) of the logical table.

The constraints are:

* Grouping dimensions
* Metrics
* Filters
* Date/Time

For example:

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/tables/myTable/week/dim1/dim2?metrics=myMetric&filters=dim3|id-in[foo,bar]&dateTime=2014-09-01/2018-09-08

Which would result in a table response with the metrics, dimensions, and available intervals restricted down to the set
of items that are still "reachable" given the constraints in the query. So, if the table normally indicates that `dim7`
is one of it's dimensions, but there isn't a backing physical table for `myTable` that has `dim1`, `dim2`, `dim3`, and
`myMetric` along with `dim7`, then `dim7` would not be in the dimension list returned in the response. 

In the example above, query accepts an optional list of path separated grouping dimensions, an optional list of metrics,
an optional filter clause, and an interval parameter. An example response could be

```json
{
      "category": "General",
      "name": "shapes",
      "longName": "shapes",
      "timeGrain": "day",
      "retention": "P1Y",
      "description": "shapes",
      "availableIntervals": ["2016-05-01 00:00:00.000/2017-05-27 00:00:00.000"],
      "dimensions": [
        {
          "cardinality": "0",
          "category": "General",
          "name": "color",
          "longName": "color",
          "uri": "http://localhost:9998/dimensions/color"
        }
      ],
      "metrics": [
        {
          "category": "General",
          "name":"rowNum",
          "longName": "rowNum",
          "uri": "http://localhost:9998/metrics/rowNum"
        }
      ]
    }
```

Note the line`"availableIntervals": ["2016-05-01 00:00:00.000/2017-05-27 00:00:00.000"]`.

Query Options
-------------

Many of the resources in the Fili API support different query options. Here are the different options that are
supported, and how the use the options:

- [Pagination / Limit](#pagination--limit)
- [Response Format](#response-format)
- [Filename](#filename)
- [Filtering](#filtering)
- [Having](#having)
- [Dimension Field Selection](#dimension-field-selection)
- [Sorting](#sorting)

### Pagination / Limit ###

Pagination allows us to split our rows into pages, and then retrieve only the desired page. So rather than getting one 
giant response with a million result rows and then write code to extract rows 5000 to 5999 ourselves, we can use 
pagination to break the response into a thousand pages, each with a thousand result rows, and then ask for page 5.

At this point, only the [Dimension](#dimensions) and [Data](#data-queries) endpoints support pagination.

In addition to containing only the desired page of results, the response also contains pagination metadata. Currently, 
the dimension and data endpoints show different metadata, but there are plans to have the dimension endpoint display
the same kind of metadata as the data endpoint.

To paginate a resource that supports it, there are two query parameters at your disposal:

- **perPage**: How many result rows/resources to have on a page. Takes a positive integer as a parameter.

- **page**: Which page to return, with `perPage` rows per page. Takes a positive integer as a parameter.

With these two parameters, we can, for example, get the [2nd page with 3 records per page](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=2):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=2
   
With all response formats, a `link` header is added to the HTTP response. These are links to the first, last, next, and
previous pages with `rel` attributes `first`, `last`, `next`, and `prev` respectively. If we use our [previous example](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=2),    
the link header in the response would be:
    
     Link: 
        https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=1; rel="first",
        https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=3; rel="last"
        https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=3; rel="next",
        https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=1; rel="prev",

There are, however, a few differences between pagination for Dimension and Data endpoints:

#### Data #####
    
For JSON (and JSON-API) responses, a `meta` object is included in the body of the response:
 
```json
"meta": {
    "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 2,
        "rowsPerPage": 3,
        "numberOfResults": 7
        "first": "https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=1",
        "previous": "https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=1",
        "next": "https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=3",
        "last": "https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=3"
    }
}
```

The `meta` object contains a `pagination` object which contains links to the `first`, `last`, `next` and `previous`
pages. The `meta` object contains other information as well:

- `currentPage` : The page currently being displayed
- `rowsPerPage` : The number of rows on each page
- `numberOfResults` : The total number of rows in the entire result

_Note: For the data endpoint, **both** the `perPage` and `page` parameters must be provided. The data endpoint has no 
default pagination._

##### Pagination Links #####

When paginating, the `first` and `last` links will always be present, but the `next` and `previous` links will only be
included in the response if there is at least 1 page either after or before the requested page. Or, to put it another
way, the response for the [1st page](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=1)
won't include a link to the `previous` page, and the response for the [last page](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&perPage=3&page=3)
won't include a link to the `next` page.

#### Dimension ####

Currently, the dimension endpoint only prints the `previous` and `next` links inside the top-level JSON object. It does, 
however, include the same links in the headers as the data endpoint: `first`, `last`, `next` and `prev`.

Unlike the Data endpoint, the Dimension endpoint _always_ paginates. It defaults to page 1, and 10000 rows per page. The
default rows per page is configurable, and may be adjusted by modifying the configuration `default_per_page.` 

_Note that `default_per_page` applies **only** to the Dimension endpoint. It does not affect the Data endpoint._

- **perPage**:
    Setting only the `perPage` parameter also gives a "limit" behavior, returning only the top `perPage` rows.

    [Example](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?perPage=2): `GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?perPage=2`
    
    _Note: This will likely change to not return "all" by default in a future version_
    
- **page**:    
    `page` defaults to 1, the first page.

    Note: In order to use `page`, the `perPage` query parameter must also be set.

    [Example](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?perPage=2&page=2): `GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?perPage=2&page=2`

### Response Format ###

Some resources support different response formats. The default response format is JSON, and some resources also support
the CSV and JSON-API formats.

To change the format of a response, use the `format` query string parameter.

[JSON](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=json): `GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=json`

```json
{
    "rows": [
        {

        }
    ]
}
```

```

[JSON-API](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=jsonapi): `GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=jsonapi`

```json

            "desc": "Female"
        },{
            "id": "m",
            "desc": "Male"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Filename ###

The default naming formula can produce attachments with long, hard to parse names. Fili provides the `filename` query
string parameter, which specifies a filename for the result attachment to be downloaded as. The format of the attachment
is determined by the `format` parameter defined above. As such, do not provide a file extension to the `filename` query.

For example, the [query](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=json&filename=data): `GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&format=json&filename=data`

downloads an attachment `data.json`

The presence of the `filename` parameter indicates that the response should be downloaded as an attachment. Otherwise 
the response is rendered by the browser. The exception to this is the CSV format, which is always downloaded.

### Filtering ###

Filters allow you to filter by [dimension](#dimension) values. What is being filtered depends on the resource, but the
general format for filters and their logical meaning is the same regardless of resource.

The general format of a single filter is:

    dimensionName|dimensionField-filterOperation[some,list,of,url,encoded,filter,strings]

These filters can be combined by comma-separating each individual filter, and the filter strings are [URL-encoded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding),
comma-separated values:

    myDim|id-contains[foo,bar],myDim|id-notin[baz],yourDim|desc-startswith[Once%20upon%20a%20time,in%20a%20galaxy]

These are the available filter operations (Though not all of them are supported by all endpoints):

- **in**: `In` filters are an exact match on a filter string, where only matching rows are included
- **notin**: `Not In` filters are an exact match on a filter string, where all rows _except_ matching rows are included
- **contains**: `Contains` filters search for the filter string to be contained in the searched field, and work like an 
    `in` filter
- **startswith**: `Starts With` filters search for the filter string to be at the beginning of the searched field, and 
    work like an `in` filter

Let's take an example, and break down what it means.

[Example](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas%20Region,Europe%20Region],productRegion|desc-contains[Region]): 

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/dimensions/productRegion/values?filters=productRegion|id-notin[Americas%20Region,Europe%20Region],productRegion|desc-contains[Region]

What this filter parameter means is the following: 

    Return dimension values that 
        don't have 
            productRegion dimension values 
            with an ID of "Americas Region" or "Europe Region", 
        and have 
            productRegion dimension values 
            with a description that contains "Region".


### Having ###

Having clauses allow you to to filter out result rows based on conditions on aggregated metrics. 
This is similar to, but distinct from [Filtering](#filtering), which allows you to filter out results based on 
dimensions. As a result, the format for writing a having clause is very similar to that of a filter. 

The general format of a single having clause is:

    metricName-operator[x,y,z]
    
where the parameters `x, y, z` are numbers (integer or float) in decimal (`3, 3.14159`) or scientific (`4e8`) notation. 
Although three numbers are used in the template above, the list of parameters may be of any length, but must be 
non-empty.

These clauses can be combined by comma-separating individual clauses:

    metricName1-greaterThan[w,x],metricName2-equals[y],metricName3-notLessThan[y, z]
  
which is read as _return all rows such that metricName1 is greater than w or x, and metricName2 is
equal to y, and metricName3 is less than neither y nor z_.

Note that you may only perform a having filter on metrics that have been requested in the `metrics` clause.

Following are the available having operators. Each operator has an associated shorthand. The shorthand is indicated
in parenthesis after the name of the operator. Both the full name and the shorthand may be used in a query.

- **equal(eq)**: `Equal` returns rows whose having-metric is equal to at least one of the specified values.
- **greaterThan(gt)**: `Greater Than` returns rows whose having-metric is strictly greater than at least one of the
specified values.
- **lessThan(lt)**: `Less Than` returns rows whose having-metric is strictly less than at least one of the specified 
values.

Each operation may also be prefixed with `not`, which negates the operation. So `noteq` returns all the rows whose
having-metric is equal to _none_ of the specified values.

Let's take [an example](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews,users&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&having=pageViews-notgt[4e9],users-lt[1e8]) and break down what it means.

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day?metrics=pageViews,users&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08&having=pageViews-notgt[4e9],users-lt[1e8]

What this having clause means is the following: 

    Return the page views and users of all events aggregated at the day level from September 1 to 
    September 8, 2014 that
         have at most 400 million page views
         and 
         have strictly more than 100 million users
         
#### Caveats ####         

The having filter is only applied at the Druid level. Therefore, the results of a having filter are not guaranteed to
be accurate if Fili performs any post-Druid calculations on one of the metrics being filtered on.
         
### Dimension Field Selection ###

By default, a query's response will return the id and description for each dimension in the request. However, you may be
interested in more information about the dimensions, or less. To do this, you can [specify a `show` clause on the
relevant dimension path segment](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion;show=desc/userCountry;show=id,regionId/?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/productRegion;show=desc/userCountry;show=id,regionId/?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-08

The results for this query will only show the description field for the Product Region dimension, and both the id and 
region id fields for the User Country dimension. In general you add `show` to a dimension with a semicolon, then
`show=<fieldnames>`. Use commas to separate in multiple fields in the same show clause:

    /<dimension>;show=<field>,<field>,<field>

#### Field selection keywords ####

There are a couple of keywords that can be used when selecting fields to `show`:

- **All**: Include all fields for the dimension in the response
- **None**: Include only the key field in the dimension. 

The `none` keyword also simplifies the response to keep the size as small as possible. The simplifications applied to
the response depend on the format of the response:

##### JSON #####
Instead of the normal format for each requested field for a dimension (`"dimensionName|fieldName":"fieldValue"`), each 
record in the response will only have a single entry for the dimension who's value is the value of the key-field for
that dimension (`"dimensionName":"keyFieldValue"`)

##### CSV #####
Instead of the normal header format for each requested field for a dimension (`"dimensionName|fieldName":"fieldValue"`),
the headers of the response will only have a single entry for the dimension, which will be the dimension's name. The
values of the column for that dimension will be the key-field for that dimension.

##### JSON-API #####
The `none` keyword for a dimension prevents the sidecar object for that dimension from being included in the response.

            
### Sorting ###

Sorting of the records in a response [can be done](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/day/gender?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-09-01/2014-09-02&sort=pageViews|asc)
using the `sort` query parameter like so: 

    sort=myMetric

By default, sorting is _descending_, however Fili supports sorting in both descending or ascending order. To specify the
sort direction for a metric, you need to specify both the metric you want to sort on, as well as the direction, 
separated by a pipe (`|`) like so:

    sort=myMetric|asc

Sorting by multiple metrics, with a mixture of ascending and descending, can also be done by separating each sort with a
comma:

    sort=metric1|asc,metric2|desc,metric3|desc

#### Caveats ####         

There are, however, a few catches to this:

- Only the Data resource supports sorting
- Records are always sorted by `dateTime` first, and then by any sorts specified in the query, so records are always
  sorted _within_ a timestamp
- Sort is only supported on Metrics
- Sorting is only applied at the Druid level. Therefore, the results of a sort are not guaranteed to be accurate if Fili 
performs any post-Druid calculations on one of the metrics that you are sorting on.

### TopN ###

Suppose we would like to know which three pages have the top three pageview counts for each week between January and 
September 2014. We can easily answer such a question with a `topN` query. `topN` queries allow us to ask for the top 
results for each time bucket, up to a limit `n` in a request. Of course, a `topN` query implies that some sort of ordering has been imposed
 on the data. Therefore, a `topN` query has two components:

1. `topN=n` where `n` is the number of results to return for each bucket
2. `sort=metricName|dir` telling Fili how to sort the results before filtering down to the top N. See the section on 
[sorting](#sorting) for more details about the sort clause.

Going back to the sample question at the start of the section, let's see how that looks as a
[Fili query](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/pages?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-06-01/2014-08-31&topN=3&sort=pageViews|desc):

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/pages?metrics=pageViews&dateTime=2014-06-01/2014-08-31&topN=3&sort=pageViews|desc

We want the three highest pageview counts for each week, so `n` is set to three, and the query is aggregated to the week
granularity. Furthermore, we want the three _largest_ pagecounts. Therefore, we sort `pageViews` in descending order (the
first entry is the highest, the second entry is the lowest, and so on).

Fili also supports asking for metrics in addition to the one being sorted on in `topN` queries. Suppose we want to know the [daily average time 
spent (`dayAvgTimeSpent`) on the three pages with the highest number of page views for each week between January 6th and September 
1st](https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/pages?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-06-01/2014-08-31&topN=3&sort=pageViews|desc).

Thus, we can add `dayAvgTimeSpent` to our original `topN` query:

    GET https://sampleapp.fili.io/v1/data/network/week/pages?metrics=pageViews,dayAvgTimeSpent&dateTime=2014-06-01/2014-08-31&topN=3&sort=pageViews|desc

#### Caveats ####

When executing a `topN` query with multiple metrics, Fili will compute the top N results using the sorted metric _only_.

Remember that `topN` provides the top N results _for each time bucket_. Therefore, when we ask a `topN` query, we will
get `n * numBuckets` results. In both of the examples above, we would get `3 * 34 = 102` results. If you are only
interested in the first `n` results, see [pagination/limit](#pagination--limit).

Asynchronous Queries
--------------------
Fili supports asynchronous data queries. A new parameter `asyncAfter` is added on data queries. The `asyncAfter`
parameter will control whether a data query should always be synchronous, or transition from synchronous to asynchronous
 on the fly. If `asyncAfter=never` then Fili will wait indefinitely for the data, and hold the connection with the
 client open as long as allowed by the network. This will be the default. However, the default behavior of `asyncAfter`
 may be modified by setting the `default_asyncAfter` configuration parameter. If `asyncAfter=always`, the query is
 asynchronous immediately. If `asyncAfter=t` for some positive integer `t`, then _at least_ `t` milliseconds will pass
 before the query becomes asynchronous. Note however that the timing is best effort. The query may take longer than
 `t` milliseconds and still be synchronous. In other words, `asyncAfter=0` and `asyncAfter=always` do not mean the same
 thing. It is possible for `asyncAfter=0` to return the query results synchronously (this may happen if the results come
 back sufficiently fast). It is _impossible_ for the query results to return synchronously if `asyncAfter=always`.

If the timeout passes, and the data has not come back, then the user receives a `202 Accepted` response and the
[job meta-data](#job-meta-data).


### Jobs Endpoint
The jobs endpoint is the one stop shop for queries about asynchronous jobs. This endpoint is responsible for:

1. Providing a list of [all jobs](#get-ting-summary-of-all-jobs) in the system.
2. Providing the status of a [particular job](#get-ting-job-status) queried via the `jobs/TICKET` resource.
3. Providing access to the [results](#get-ting-results) via the `jobs/TICKET/results` resource.

#### GET-ting summary of all jobs
A user may get the status of all jobs by sending a `GET` to `jobs` endpoint.

```
https://HOST:PORT/v1/jobs
```
If no jobs are available in the system, an empty collection is returned.

The `jobs` endpoint supports filtering on job fields (i.e. `userId`, `status`), using the same syntax as the
[data endpoint filters](#filtering). For example:

`userId-eq[greg, joan], status-eq[success]`

resolves into the following boolean operation:

`(userId = greg OR userId = joan) AND status = success`

which will return only those Jobs created by `greg` and `joan` that have completed successfully.

#### GET-ting Job Status
When the user sends a `GET` request to `jobs/TICKET`, Fili will look up the specified ticket and return the job's
meta-data as follows:

###### Job meta-data
```json
{
    "query": "https://HOST:PORT/v1/data/QUERY",
    "results": "https://HOST:PORT/v1/jobs/TICKET/results",
    "syncResults": "https://HOST:PORT/v1/jobs/TICKET/results?asyncAfter=never",
    "self": "https://HOST:PORT/v1/jobs/TICKET",
    "status": ONE OF ["pending", "success", "error"],
    "jobTicket": "TICKET",
    "dateCreated": "ISO 8601 DATETIME",
    "dateUpdated": "ISO 8601 DATETIME",
    "userId": "Foo"
}
```
* `query` is the original query
* `results` provides a link to the data, whether it is fully synchronous or switches from
   synchronous to asynchronous after a timeout depends on the default setting of `asyncAfter`.
* `syncResults` provides a synchronous link to the data (note the `asyncAfter=never` parameter)
* `self` provides a link that returns the most up-to-date version of this job
* `status` indicates the status of the results pointed to by this ticket
    - `pending` - The job is being worked on
    - `success` - The job has been completed successfully
    - `error` - The job failed with an error
    - `canceled` - The job was canceled by the user (coming soon)
* `jobTicket` is a unique identifier for the job
* `dateCreated` is the date on which the job was created
* `dateUpdated` when the job's status was last updated
* `userId` is an identifier for the user who submitted this job

If the ticket is not available in the system, we get a 404 error with the message `No job found with job ticket TICKET`

#### GET-ting Results
The user may access the results of a query by sending a `GET` request to `jobs/TICKET/results`. This
resource takes the following parameters:

1. **`format`** - Allows the user to specify a response format, i.e. csv, or JSON. This behaves
just like the [`format`](#response-format) parameter on queries sent to the `data` endpoint.

2. **`filename`** - Allows the user to specify a filename for the result to be downloaded as. This behaves
just like the [`filename`](#filename) parameter on queries sent to the `data` endpoint.

3. **`page`, `perPage`** - The [pagination](#pagination--limit) parameters. Their behavior is the same as when sending
a query to the `data` endpoint, and allow the user to get pages of the results.

4. **`asyncAfter`** - Allows the user to specify how long they are willing to wait for results from the
result store. Behaves like the [`asyncAfter`](async) parameter on the `data` endpoint.

If the results for the given ticket are ready, we get the results in the format specified. Otherwise, we get the
[job's metadata](#job-meta-data).

##### Long Polling
If clients wish to long poll for the results, they may send a `GET` request to
`https://HOST:PORT/v1/jobs/TICKET/results?asyncAfter=never` (the query linked to under the
`syncResults` field in the async response). This request will perform like a synchronous query: Fili
will not send a response until all of the data is ready.

Misc

### Dates and Times ###

The date interval is specified using the `dateTime` parameter in the format `dateTime=d1/d2`. The first date is the start date, and the second is the non-inclusive end date. For example, `dateTime=2015-10-01/2015-10-03` will return the data for October 1st and 2nd, but not the 3rd. Dates can be one of: 

1. ISO 8601 formatted date
2. ISO 8601 duration  (see below)
3. Date macro (see below)

We have followed the ISO 8601 standards as closely as possible in the API. Wikipedia has a [great article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) on ISO 8601 dates and times if you want to dig deep. 

#### Date Periods  (ISO 8601 Durations) ####

Date Periods have been implemented in accordance with the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). Briefly, a period is specified by the letter `P`, followed by a number and then a timegrain (M=month,W=week,D=day,etc).  For example, if you wanted 30 days of data, you would specify `P30D`.  The number and period may be repeated, so `P1Y2M` is an interval of one year and two months. 

This period can take the place of either the start or end date in the query.

#### Date Macros ####

We have created a macro named `current`, which will always be translated to the beginning of the current time grain period.  For example, if your time grain is `day`, then `current` will resolve to today’s date.  If your query time grain is `month`, then `current` will resolve to the first of the current month.

There is also a similar macro named `next` which resolves to the beginning of the next interval. For example, if your time grain is `day`, then, `next` will resolve to tomorrow's date.

#### Time Zone

Currently, time zone cannot be specified for the start or stop instants of an interval. Instead, the time zone of a query can be changed via the `timeZone` query parameter. This changes the time zone in which the intervals specified in the `dateTime` are interpreted. By default, the query will use the default time zone of the API, but any [time zone identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List) can be specified to override that. For example, specifying query parameters

    dateTime=2016-09-16/2016-09-17&timeZone=America/Los_Angeles
    vs
    dateTime=2016-09-16/2016-09-17&timeZone=America/Chicago

will result in the intervals resolving to

    2016-09-16 00:00:00-07:00/2016-09-17 00:00:00-07:00
    and
    2016-09-16 00:00:00-05:00/2016-09-17 00:00:00-05:00

<sub>Note the hour offsets on the interval instants.</sub>

### Case Sensitivity ###

Everything in the API is case-sensitive, which means `pageViews` is not the same as `pageviews` is not the same as 
`PaGeViEwS`.

### Rate Limiting ###

To prevent abuse of the system, the API only allows each user to have a certain number of data requests being processed
at any one time. If you try to make another request that would put you above the allowed limit, you will be given an
error response with an HTTP response status code of 429.  

### Errors ###

There are a number of different errors you may encounter when interacting with the API. All of them are indicated by the
HTTP response status code, and most of them have a helpful message indicating what went wrong.

| Code | Meaning                         | Cause                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
