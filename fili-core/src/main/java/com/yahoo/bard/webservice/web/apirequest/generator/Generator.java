 * Contract for a builder of a piece of a {@link com.yahoo.bard.webservice.web.apirequest.DataApiRequest}. Each

 * in progress api request.
 *
 * <p>To modify how a data api request is built, you must implement this interface for the type of resource you want
 * to generate. In your {@link AbstractBinderFactory} implementation you must make a named binding for the type of
 * resource you wish to generate. You can only bind one generator per resource (though different resources may share
 * a type, such as "count" and "topN"), so your implementation will replace the default generator for that resource.

 * TODO: binding order should be written here
