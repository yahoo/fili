     * Builds the LogicalMetric expected by the tests.
     * <p>
     * The expected metric contains a nested query. The inner query performs a sketch merge
     * of users across the time grain of day, giving us a sketch of all users for each day.
     * The inner query then performs a user provided post aggregation (typically some kind of sketch estimate), as
     * well as a constant post aggregation that assigns to each record the number 1 (which
     * will be used for counting).
     * <p>
     * The outer query computes the average daily users across each week. First, it sums up all the estimates
     * from the inner query. Then it sums up all of the counts (giving us the number of days with data).
     * Finally, it divides the sketch estimate sum by the count sum.
     * <p>
     * Note that manually counting the days is a workaround because the Druid count aggregator didn't do
     * what we needed when the AggregationAverageMaker was implemented. That may have changed.
     * <p>
     * Building the usersSketchEstimate post aggregation is a little bit weird, because of some workarounds to
     * get around sketch count weirdness. A sketch count aggregation is converted into a sketch merge aggregation
     * and sketch estimate post aggregation. However, the sketch estimate post aggregation uses the original sketch
     * aggregation (i.e. sketch count) as the aggregation in its field, not the constructed sketch merge. This
     * doesn't seem to affect the correctness of the program, but it does mean that the manually constructed
     * PostAggregation has to use a sketch count as its field in order to pass the equality test.
     *
     * @param innerPostAggregation The test-specific post aggregation to be added to the inner query.
