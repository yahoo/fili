### Added:

- [Documentation for topN](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/43)


### Changed:

- [Improves error messages when querying Druid goes wrong](https:://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/61)
    - The `ResponseException` now includes a message that prints the `ResponseException`'s internal state 
        (i.e. the druid query and response code) using the error messages 
        `ErrorMessageFormat::FAILED_TO_SEND_QUERY_TO_DRUID` and `ErrorMessageFormat::ERROR_FROM_DRUID`
    - The druid query and status code, reason and response body are now logged at the error level in the 
      failure and error callbacks in `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl`  
          
- [Fili now supports custom Druid query types](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/57)
    * `QueryType` has been turned into an interface, backed by an enum `DefaultQueryType`.
        - The default implementations of `DruidResponseParser` `DruidQueryBuilder`, `WeightEvaluationQuery` and
          `TestDruidWebService` only support `DefaultQueryType`.
    * `DruidResponseParser` is now injectable by overriding `AbstractBinderFactory::buildDruidResponseParser` method.
    * `DruidQueryBuilder` is now injectable by overriding `AbstractBinderFactory::buildDruidQueryBuilder` method.

- [Updated commons-collections4 dependency from 4.0 to 4.1 to address a security vulnerability in the library.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/52)
  * For details see: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/security-reports.html#Apache_Commons_Collections_Security_Vulnerabilities
  * It should be noted that Fili does not make use of any the serialization/deserialization capabilities of any classes
    in the functor package, so the security vulnerability does not affect Fili.

- Clean up build plugins
  * Move some plugin configs up to `pluginManagement`
  * Make `fili-core` publish test javadocs
  * Default source plugin to target `jar-no-fork` instead of `jar`
  * Default javadoc plugin to target `javadoc-no-fork` as well as `jar`
  * Move some versions up to `pluginManagement`
  * Remove overly (and un-usedly) specified options in surfire plugin configs
  * Make all projects pull in the `source` plugin

- Corrected bug with Fili sub-module dependency specification
  * Dependency versions are now set via a fixed property at deploy time, rather than relying on `project.version`

- Cleaned up dependencies in pom files
  * Moved version management of dependencies up to the parent Pom's dependency management section
  * Cleaned up the parent Pom's dependency section to only be those dependencies that truly _every_ sub-project should 
    depend on.
  * Cleaned up sub-project Pom dependency sections to handle and better use the dependencies the parent Pom provides 

### Deprecated:



### Fixed:

- [Adds read locking to all attempts to read the Lucene index](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/52)
  * Before, if Fili attempted to read from the Lucene indices (i.e. processing a query with filters)
    while loading dimension indices, the request would fail and we would get a
    `LuceneIndexReaderAlreadyClosedException`. Now, the read locks should
    ensure that the query processing will wait until indexing completes (and vice versa).

- [Fixes a bug where job metadata was being stored in the `ApiJobStore` even when the results came back synchronously](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/49)
  * The workflow that updates the job's metadata with `success` was running even when the query was synchronous. That 
    update also caused the ticket to be stored in the `ApiJobStore`.
  * The delay operator didn't stop the "update" workflow from executing because it viewed an `Observable::onCompleted`
    call as a message for the purpose of the delay. Since the two observables that that the metadata update gated on are
    empty when the query is synchronous, the "update metadata" workflow was being triggered every time.
  * The delay operator was replaced by `zipWith` as a gating mechanism.
    
- [#45, removing sorting from weight check queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/46)

- [`JsonSlurper` can now handle sorting lists with mixed-type entries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/58)
  * even if the list starts with a string, number, or boolean
  
- [Broken segment metadata with Druid v0.9.1](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/63)
  * Made `NumberedShardSpec` ignore unexpected properties during deserialization
  * Added tests to `DataSourceMetadataLoaderSpec` to test the v.0.9.1 optional field 'shardSpec.partitionDimensions' on segment info JSON.


### Known Issues:



### Removed:




v0.1.x - 2016/09/23
-------------------

This release focuses on stabilization, especially of the Query Time Lookup (QTL) capabilities, and the Async API and
Jobs resource. Here are the highlights of what's in this release:

- A bugfix for the `DruidDimensionLoader`
- A new default `DimensionLoader`
- A bunch more tests and test upgrades
- Filtering and pagination on the Jobs resource
- A `userId` field for default Job resource representations
- Package cleanup for the jobs-related classes
 
### Added:

- [`always` keyword for the `asyncAfter` parameter now guarantees that a query will be asynchronous](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)

- [A test implementation of the `AsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`: `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * Identical to the `DefaultAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`, except that it includes hooks to allow outside forces (i.e.
    Specifications) to add additional subscribers to each workflow.

- [Functional tests for Asynchronous queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * Jobs endpoint now supports filters

- [Enrich the ApiJobStore interface] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/23)
  * `ApiJobStore` interface now supports filtering `JobRows` in the store
  * Added support for filtering JobRows in `HashJobStore`
  * Added `JobRowFilter` to hold filter information

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Added two tests `LookupDimensionFilteringDataServletSpec` and `LookupDimensionGroupingDataServletSpec` to test QTL 
    functionality

- [Lookup Dimension Serializer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/31)
  * Created `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` serializer for `LookupDimension`
  * Created corresponding tests for `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` in `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpecSpec`

### Deprecated:

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Deprecated `KeyValueDimensionLoader`, in favor of `TypeAwareDimensionLoader`

### Changed:

#### Jobs:

- [HashPreResponseStore moved to `test` root directory.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * The `HashPreResponseStore` is really intended only for testing, and does not have capabilities (i.e. TTL) that are
    needed for production.

- [The `TestBinderFactory` now uses the `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * This allows the asynchronous functional tests to add countdown latches to the workflows where necessary, allowing
    for thread-safe tests.

- [Removed `JobsApiRequest::handleBroadcastChannelNotification`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * That logic does not really belong in the `JobsApiRequest` (which is responsible for modeling a response, not 
    processing it), and has been consolidated into the `JobsServlet`.

- [ISSUE-17](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/17) [Added pagination parameters to `PreResponse`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19) 
  * Updated `JobsServlet::handlePreResponseWithError` to update `ResultSet` object with pagination parameters

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * The default job payload generated by `DefaultJobPayloadBuilder` now has a `userId`

- [Removed timing component in JobsApiRequestSpec](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/27)
  * Rather than setting an async timeout, and then sleeping, `JobsApiRequestSpec::handleBroadcastChannelNotification` 
    returns an empty Observable if a timeout occurs before the notification is received now verifies that the Observable
    returned terminates without sending any messages.

- [Reorganizes asynchronous package structure](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)
  * The `jobs` package is renamed to `async` and split into the following subpackages:
    - `broadcastchannels` - Everything dealing with broadcast channels
    - `jobs` - Everything related to `jobs`, broken into subpackages
      * `jobrows` - Everything related to the content of the job metadata
      * `payloads` - Everything related to building the version of the job metadata to send to the user
      * `stores` - Everything related to the databases for job data
    - `preresponses` - Everything related to `PreResponses`, broken into subpackages
      * `stores` - Everything related to the the databases for PreResponse data
    - `workflows` - Everything related to the asynchronous workflow

#### Query Time Lookup (QTL)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * `AbstractBinderFactory` now uses `TypeAwareDimensionLoader` instead of `KeyValueStoreDimensionLoader`

- [Fix Dimension Serialization Problem with Nested Queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/15)
  * Modified `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec` serializer to serialize Dimension to apiName if it's not in the 
    inner-most query
  * Added `Util::hasInnerQuery` helper in serializer package to determine if query is the inner most query or not
  * Added tests for `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec`
    
#### General:

- [Preserve collection order of dimensions, dimension fields and metrics](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/25)
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensions` now returns a `LinkedHashSet`
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>`
  * `DataApiRequest::withPerDimensionFields` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` as its second argument.
  * `DataApiRequest::getDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `Response::Response` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>` as
    its second  and third arguments.
  * `ResponseContext::dimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now takes a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `ResponseContext::getDimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`

- [`TestDruidWebService::jsonResponse` is now a `Producer<String>` Producer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Modified some testing resources (PETS table and corresponding dimensions) to allow better testing on `LookupDimension`s

- [Memoize generated values during recursive class-scan class construction](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/29)

### Fixed:

- [Fixing the case when the security context is not complete](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/67)
  * Check for nulls in the `DefaultJobRowBuilder.userIdExtractor` function.

- [`DruidDimensionsLoader` doesn't set the dimension's lastUpdated date](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/24)
  * `DruidDimensionsLoader` now properly sets the `lastUpdated` field after it finished processing the Druid response
