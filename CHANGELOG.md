Current
-------

### Fixed:

### Added:
- [Support recurance rules in dateTime expression](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1195)
   * Added explicit type parsing to dateTime Elements
   * Added library to parse RRules from the dateTime elements
   * Enhanced switches for various combinations of dateTimeElements
   * Additional testing on new and old paths
   * Created a limit parameter to prevent infinite recurrance rules from generating infinite reporting intervals.
   

### Changed:
- [Enhance Rate Limiting Capability](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1188)
   * Add UI and non-UI user count capability to rate limiter
   
- [Make LookBackQuery Extensible](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1182)
   * Make field and constructor less private

- [Make GroupBy Query Extensible](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1181)
   * Make field less private

- [Make Data Servlet Extensible](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1176)
  * Make field less private
  * Decomposed getData into overridable methods

- [Make DataApiRequest Servlet Extensible](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1176)
  * Add parent subclass with query parameters to support adding general query elements

- [Support unnamed dimension fields](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1179)

- [Support virtual dimensions](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1179)
  * Virtual dimensions have no storage associated with them and no physical columns
  * Virtual dimensions will be bound in children of `ExtensibleDataApiRequestImpl` to maintain backwards compatibility for now in `DataApiRequestImpl`
  * `SimpleVirtualDimension`  will have its columns serialized without '|fieldname'
  * Output columns are not driven by requested columns not columns in the result set.  Missing dimension rows will be expressed as null field values.
  * parsing of PerDimensionFields will no longer rely on dimension dictionary but instead on the already chosen grouping dimensions
  *  `REQUESTED_API_DIMENSION_FIELDS` context property was added to support JobServlet asynchronous requests, however it doesn't work well with VirtualDimensions so if the ApiRequest is able to be the authority on requested fields it will be used instead.
  * `DataServlet` sanitized empty path elements early to avoid validation later

- [Support null valued dimension, metric and time values to be null]https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1183)  
   * Result to support null serialization of time, dimensions
   * Sortable nullable DateTime in ResultSetMapper
   * TimeDimensionResultSetMapper pulls dimension time into timestamp 
   * TimeDimension SimpleVirtualDimension to simplify time injecting queries
   * Made virtual dimension equality based on apiName (to allow distinct but equal request and response dimensions)

- [Bumping druid api dependency] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1174)
   * Moved druid dependency to Druid 0.20
   * Disabled jackson validation error

- [Moving having and limitspec support to an interface and abstract implementation](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1185)
   * Added an interface for the group by and other related query types to offer abstract support for limitspec and having
   * Deprecated withOrderBy because there hasn't been a lot of conceptual gain drawing a line between logical and actual sort implementations.
   * Made `LookbackQuery` support withDimensions in cases where the inner datasource supports withDimensions.
   * Made `GroupByQuery` devolve limitspec and having support to parent abstract class.
      
- [Add MetricType subType and metadata](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/1189)
   * Elaborated type into a class in `LogicalMetricInfo` supporting subtype and metadata
   * Updated metric makers to support type overrides
   * Updated ProtocolMetric generator to support modifying types
   * Updated `ThetaSketchMaker` to demonstrate having a type generated on the Maker that captured sketch precision as metadata.
