### Added:



### Changed:

- Cleaned up dependencies in pom files
  * Moved version management of dependencies up to the parent Pom's dependency management section
  * Cleaned up the parent Pom's dependency section to only be those dependencies that truly _every_ sub-project should 
    depend on.
  * Cleaned up sub-project Pom dependency sections to handle and better use the dependencies the parent Pom provides

v0.1.x - 2016/09/23
-------------------

This release focuses on stabilization, especially of the Query Time Lookup (QTL) capabilities, and the Async API and
Jobs resource. Here are the highlights of what's in this release:

- A bugfix for the `DruidDimensionLoader`
- A new default `DimensionLoader`
- A bunch more tests and test upgrades
- Filtering and pagination on the Jobs resource
- A `userId` field for default Job resource representations
- Package cleanup for the jobs-related classes
 
### Added:

- [`always` keyword for the `asyncAfter` parameter now guarantees that a query will be asynchronous](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)

- [A test implementation of the `AsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`: `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * Identical to the `DefaultAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`, except that it includes hooks to allow outside forces (i.e.
    Specifications) to add additional subscribers to each workflow.

- [Functional tests for Asynchronous queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * Jobs endpoint now supports filters

- [Enrich the ApiJobStore interface] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/23)
  * `ApiJobStore` interface now supports filtering `JobRows` in the store
  * Added support for filtering JobRows in `HashJobStore`
  * Added `JobRowFilter` to hold filter information

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Added two tests `LookupDimensionFilteringDataServletSpec` and `LookupDimensionGroupingDataServletSpec` to test QTL 
    functionality

- [Lookup Dimension Serializer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/31)
  * Created `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` serializer for `LookupDimension`
  * Created corresponding tests for `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` in `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpecSpec`

### Deprecated:

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Deprecated `KeyValueDimensionLoader`, in favor of `TypeAwareDimensionLoader`

### Changed:

#### Jobs:

- [HashPreResponseStore moved to `test` root directory.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * The `HashPreResponseStore` is really intended only for testing, and does not have capabilities (i.e. TTL) that are
    needed for production.

- [The `TestBinderFactory` now uses the `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * This allows the asynchronous functional tests to add countdown latches to the workflows where necessary, allowing
    for thread-safe tests.

- [Removed `JobsApiRequest::handleBroadcastChannelNotification`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * That logic does not really belong in the `JobsApiRequest` (which is responsible for modeling a response, not 
    processing it), and has been consolidated into the `JobsServlet`.

- [ISSUE-17](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/17) [Added pagination parameters to `PreResponse`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)â€¨
  * Updated `JobsServlet::handlePreResponseWithError` to update `ResultSet` object with pagination parameters

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * The default job payload generated by `DefaultJobPayloadBuilder` now has a `userId`

- [Removed timing component in JobsApiRequestSpec](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/27)
  * Rather than setting an async timeout, and then sleeping, `JobsApiRequestSpec::handleBroadcastChannelNotification` 
    returns an empty Observable if a timeout occurs before the notification is received now verifies that the Observable
    returned terminates without sending any messages.

- [Reorganizes asynchronous package structure](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)
  * The `jobs` package is renamed to `async` and split into the following subpackages:
    - `broadcastchannels` - Everything dealing with broadcast channels
    - `jobs` - Everything related to `jobs`, broken into subpackages
      * `jobrows` - Everything related to the content of the job metadata
      * `payloads` - Everything related to building the version of the job metadata to send to the user
      * `stores` - Everything related to the databases for job data
    - `preresponses` - Everything related to `PreResponses`, broken into subpackages
      * `stores` - Everything related to the the databases for PreResponse data
    - `workflows` - Everything related to the asynchronous workflow

#### Query Time Lookup (QTL)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * `AbstractBinderFactory` now uses `TypeAwareDimensionLoader` instead of `KeyValueStoreDimensionLoader`

- [Fix Dimension Serialization Problem with Nested Queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/15)
  * Modified `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec` serializer to serialize Dimension to apiName if it's not in the 
    inner-most query
  * Added `Util::hasInnerQuery` helper in serializer package to determine if query is the inner most query or not
  * Added tests for `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec`
    
#### General:

- [Preserve collection order of dimensions, dimension fields and metrics](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/25)
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensions` now returns a `LinkedHashSet`
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>`
  * `DataApiRequest::withPerDimensionFields` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` as its second argument.
  * `DataApiRequest::getDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `Response::Response` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>` as
    its second  and third arguments.
  * `ResponseContext::dimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now takes a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `ResponseContext::getDimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`

- [`TestDruidWebService::jsonResponse` is now a `Producer<String>` Producer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Modified some testing resources (PETS table and corresponding dimensions) to allow better testing on `LookupDimension`s

- [Memoize generated values during recursive class-scan class construction](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/29)

### Fixed:

- [`DruidDimensionsLoader` doesn't set the dimension's lastUpdated date](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/24)
  * `DruidDimensionsLoader` now properly sets the `lastUpdated` field after it finished processing the Druid response
