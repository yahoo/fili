Current
-------
### Added:

- [Implement DruidPartialDataResponseProcessor](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/275)
    * Add `FullResponseProcessor` interface that extends `ResponseProcessor`
    * Add response status code to JSON response
    * Add `DruidPartialDataResponseProcessor` that checks for any missing data that's not being found

- [Add `DataSourceName` concept, removing responsibility from `TableName`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * `TableName` was serving double-duty, and it was causing problems and confusion. Splitting the concepts fixes it.

- [Add a `BaseMetadataAvailability` as a parallel to `BaseCompositeAvailability`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * `Concrete` and `PermissiveAvailability` both extend this new base `Availability`

- [Constrained Table Support for Table Serialization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * Add ConstrainedTable which closes over a physical table and an availability, caching all availability merges.
    * Add PartialDataHandler method to use `ConstrainedTable`

- [Testing: ClassScannerSpec now supports 'discoverable' depenencies ](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * Creating 'supplyDependencies' method on a class's spec allows definitions of dependencies for dynamic equality testing

- [Moved UnionDataSource to support only single tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * `DataSource` now supports getDataSource() operation

- [Prepare For Partial Data V2](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/264)
    * Add new query context for druid's uncovered interval feature
    * Add a configurable property named "druid_uncovered_interval_limit"
    * Add new response error messages as needed by Partial Data V2

- [Merge Druid Response Header into Druid Response Body Json Node in AsyncDruidWebServiceImplV2](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/267)
    * Add configuration to `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl` so that we can opt-in configuration of JSON response content.
    * `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl` takes a strategy for building the JSON from the entire response.

- [Add MetricUnionCompositeTableDefinition](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/258)

- [Add partition availability and table](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/244)

- [Add constructor to specify DruidDimensionLoader dimensions directly](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/191)

- [Add `IntervalUtils::getTimeGrain` to determine the grain given an Interval](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/191)

- [Add example for slurping in config from a Druid instance](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/191)

- [Add Permissive Concrete Physical Table Definition](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/212)
    * Added `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTableDefinition` for defining a `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable`

- [Fix to use physical name instead of logical name to retrieve available interval](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/226)
    * Added `PhysicalDataSourceConstraint` class to capture physical names of columns for retrieving available intervals

- [BaseCompositePhysicalTable](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/242)
    * `BaseCompositePhysicalTable` provides common operations, such as validating coarsest ZonedTimeGrain, for composite
    tables.

- [Add Reciprocal `satisfies()` relationship complementing `satisfiedBy()` on Granularity](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/222)

- [Add a timer around DataApiRequestMappers](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/250)

- [MetricUnionAvailability and MetricUnionCompositeTable](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/193)
    * Added `MetricUnionAvailability` which puts metric columns of different availabilities together and
    `MetricUnionCompositeTable` which puts metric columns of different tables together in a single table.

- [Method for finding coarsest ZonedTimeGrain](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/230)
    * Added utility method for returning coarsest `ZonedTimeGrain` from a collection of `ZonedTimeGrain`s. This is
    useful to construct composite tables that requires the coarsest `ZonedTimeGrain` among a set of tables.

- [Should also setConnectTimeout when using setReadTimeout](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/231)
    * Setting connectTimeout on DefaultAsyncHttpClientConfig when building AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl

- [CompositePhysicalTable Core Components Refactor](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/179)
    * Added `ConcretePhysicalTable` and `ConcreteAvailability` to model table in druid datasource and its availabillity in the new table availability structure
    * Added class variable for `DataSourceMetadataService` and `ConfigurationLoader` into `AbstractBinderFactory` for application to access
    * Added `loadPhsycialTablesWithDependency` into `BaseTableLoader` to load physical tables with dependencies

- [PermissiveAvailability and PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/190)
    * Added `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable` and `PermissiveAvailability` to model table in druid datasource and its availability in the new table availability structure.
    `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable` and `PermissiveAvailability` extends `ConcretePhysicalTable` and `ConcreteAvailability`, respectively.
    `PermissiveAvailability` differs from `ConcreteAvailability` in the way of returning available intervals: `ConcreteAvailability` returns
    the available intervals constraint by `DataSourceConstraint` and provides them in intersection. `PermissiveAvailability`, however, returns
    them without constraint from `DataSourceConstraint` and provides them in union. `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable` is different from `ConcretePhysicalTable`
    in that the former is backed by `PermissiveAvailability` while the latter is backed by `ConcreteAvailability`.

- [Refactor DatasourceMetaDataService to fit composite table needs](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/173)
    * `DataSourceMetadataService` also stores interval data from segment data as intervals by column name map and provides method `getAvailableIntervalsByTable` to retrieve it

- [QueryPlanningConstraint and DataSourceConstraint](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/169)
    * Added `QueryPlanningConstraint` to replace current interface of Matchers and Resolvers arguments during query planning
    * Added `DataSourceConstraint` to allow implementation of `PartitionedFactTable`'s availability in the near future

- [Major refactor for availability and schemas and tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/165)
    * `ImmutableAvailability` - provides immutable, typed replacement for maps of column availabilities
    * New Table Implementations:
	    * `BasePhysicalTable` core implementation
	    * `ConcretePhysicalTable` creates an ImmutableAvailability
    * `Schema` implementations
	    * `BaseSchema` has `Columns`, `Granularity`
    	* `PhysicalTableSchema` has base plus `ZonedTimeGrain`, name mappings
	    * `LogicalTableSchema` base with builder from table group
	    * `ResultSetSchema` base with transforming with-ers
    * `ApiName`, `TableName`: Added static factory from String to Name
    * `ErrorMessageFormat` for errors during `ResultSetMapper` cycle

- [Added default base class for all dimension types](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/177)
   * Added base classes `DefaultKeyValueStoreDimensionConfig`, `DefaultLookupDimensionConfig` and `DefaultRegisteredLookupDimensionConfig` 
     to create default dimensions. 

- [dateTime based sort feature for the final ResultSet added](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/178)
   * Now we support dateTime column based sort in ASC or DESC order.
   * Added `DateTimeSortMapper` to sort the time buckets and `DateTimeSortRequestHandler` to inject to the workflow

- [dateTime specified as sortable field in sorting clause](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/170)
    * added `dateTimeSort` as class parameter in `DataApiRequest`. So it can be tracked down to decide the resultSet
      sorting direction.

- [Detect unset userPrincipal in Preface log block](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/154)
    * Logs a warning if no userPrincipal is set on the request (ie. we don't know who the user is), and sets the
      `user` field in the `Preface` log block to `NO_USER_PRINCIPAL`.
- [Support timeouts for lucene search provider](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/183)

### Changed:

- [Rename `Concrete` to `Strict` for the respective `PhysicalTable` and `Availability`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * The main difference is in the availability reduction, so make the class name match that.

- [Make `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable` and `ConcretePhysicalTable` extend from a common base](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Makes the structure match that for composite tables, so they can be reasoned about together.

- [Make `PermissiveConcretePhysicalTable` (now just `PermissivePhysicalTable`) a sibling, instead of extend from, `ConcretePhysicalTable`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * The main difference is in the accepted availabilities, so make the class structure match that.

- [Make `MetricUnionAvailability` take a set of `Availability` instead of `PhysicalTable`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Since it was just unwrapping anyways, simplifying the dependency and pushing the unwrap up-stream makes sense

- [Add `DataSourceName` concept, removing responsibility from `TableName`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Impacts:
        - `DataSource` & children
        - `DataSourceMetadataService` & `DataSourceMetadataLoader`
        - `SegmentIntervalsHashIdGenerator`
        - `PhysicalTable` & children
        - `Availability` & children
        - `ErrorMessageFormat`
        - `SlicesApiRequest`

- [Force `ConcretePhysicalTable` only take a `ConcreteAvailability`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Only a `ConcreteAvailability` makes sense, so let the types enforce it

- [Clarify name of built-in static `TableName` comparator](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Change to `AS_NAME_COMPARATOR`

- [Constrained Table Support for Table Serialization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * Switched `PartialDataRequestHandler` to use the table from the query rather than the `PhysicalTableDictionary`
    * `DruidQueryBuilder` uses constrained tables to dynamically pick between Union and Table DataSource implementations
    * `PartialDataHandler` has multiple different entrypoints now depending on pre or post constraint conditions
    * `getAvailability` moved to a `ConfigTable` interface and all configured Tables to that interface
    * DataSource implementations bind to `ConstrainedTable` and only ConstrainedTable is used after table selection
    * `PhysicalTable.getAllAvailableIntervals` explicitly rather than implicitly uses `SimplifiedIntervalList`
    * Bound and default versions of getAvailableIntervals and getAllAvailableIntervals added to PhysicalTable interface
    * Package-private optimize tests in `DruidQueryBuilder` moved to protected
    * Immutable `NoVolatileIntervalsFunction` class made final
    
- [Moved UnionDataSource to support only single tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * `UnionDataSource` now accepts only single tables instead of sets of tables.
    * `DataSource` now supports getDataSource() operation
    * `IntervalUtils.collectBucketedIntervalsNotInIntervalList` moved to `PartialDataHandler`

- [Druid filters are now lazy](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/269)
    - The Druid filter is built when requested, NOT at DatApiRequest construction. This will
        make it easier to write performant `DataApiRequest` mappers.

- [Reduce log level of failure to store a result in the asynchronous job store](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/266)
    * Customers who aren't using the asynchronous infrastructure shouldn't be seeing spurious warnings about a failure
        to execute one step (which is a no-op for them) in a complex system they aren't using. Until we can revisit how
        we log report asynchronous errors, we reduce the log level to `DEBUG` to reduce noise.

- [Clean up `BaseDataSourceComponentSpec`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Drop a log from `error` to `trace` when a response comes back as an error
    * Make JSON validation helpers return `boolean` instead of `def`

- [Make `BasePhysicalTable` take a more extension-friendly set of `PhysicalTable`s](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Take `<? extends PhysicalTable>` instead of just `PhysicalTable`

- [Update availabilities for PartitionAvailability](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/244)
    * Created `BaseCompositeAvailability` for common features
    * Refactored `DataSourceMetadataService` methods to use SimplifiedIntervaList to standardize intersections

- [Queries to Druid Web Service now return a Future](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/254)
    * Queries now return a `Future<Response>` in addition to having method callbacks.

- [Refactor Physical Table Definition and Update Table Loader](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/207)
    * `PhysicalTableDefinition` is now an abstract class, construct using `ConcretePhysicalTableDefinition` instead
    * `PhysicalTableDefinition` now requires a `build` methods to be implemented that builds a physical table
    * `BaseTableLoader` now constructs physical tables by calling `build` method on `PhysicalTableDefinition`s in `buildPhysicalTablesWithDependency`
    * `buildDimensionSpanningTableGroup` method in `BaseTableLoader` now uses `loadPhysicalTablesWithDependency` instead of deprecated `loadPhysicalTables`
    * `buildDimensionSpanningTableGroup` method in `BaseTableLoader` now does not take druid metrics as arguments, instead `PhysicalTableDefinition` does

- [Fix to use physical name instead of logical name to retrieve available interval](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/226)
    * `getAllAvailbleIntervals` in `ConcreteAvailability` no longer filters out un-configured columns, instead table's `getAllAvailbleIntervals` does
    * `getAvailbleIntervals` in `Availbality` now takes `PhysicalDataSourceConstraint` instead of `DataSourceConstraint`
    * `Availability` no longer takes a set of columns on the table, only table needs to know
    * `getAllAvailbleIntervals` in `Availability` now returns a map of column physical name string to interval list instead of column to interval list
    * `TestDataSourceMetadataService` now takes map from string to list of intervals instead of column to list of intervals for constructor

- [Reduced number of queries sent by `LuceneSearchProvider` by 50% in the common case](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/234)
    * Before, we were using `IndexSearcher::count` to get the total number of documents, which spawned an entire second query
        (so two Lucene queries rather than one when requesting the first page of results). We now pull that information from
        metadata generated by query we run to get the actual results.

- [Update LogBack version 1.1.7 -> 1.2.3](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/235)
    * In web-applications, logback-classic will automatically install a listener which will stop the logging context and
    release resources when your web-app is reloaded.
    * Logback-classic now searches for the file logback-test.xml first, logback.groovy second and logback.xml third.
    In previous versions logback.groovy was looked up first which was non-sensical in presense of logback-test.xml.
    * AsyncAppender no longer drops events when the current thread has its interrupt flag set.
    * Critical parts of the code now use COWArrayList, a custom developed allocation-free lock-free thread-safe
    implementation of the {@link List} interface. It is optimized for cases where iterations over the list vastly
    outnumber modifications on the list. It is based on CopyOnWriteArrayList but allows allocation-free iterations over
    the list.

- [Update Metrics version 3.1.2 -> 3.2.2](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/235)
    * [Added support for disabling reporting of metric attributes.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1048)
    * [Support for setting a custom initial delay for reporters.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/999)
    * [Support for custom details in a result of a health check.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/issues/663)
    * [Support for asynchronous health checks](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1077)
    * [Added a listener for health checks.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1068)
    * [Health checks are reported as unhealthy on exceptions.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/issues/783)
    * [Added support for Jetty 9.3 and higher.](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1038)
    * [Shutdown health check registry](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1084)
    * [Add support for the default shared health check registry name](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/pull/1095)

- [Update hk2 version 2.5.0-b05 -> 2.5.0-b36](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/235)
    * [Add class-proxy in the case of a generic factory using a registered contract]
    (https://github.com/hk2-project/hk2/releases)

- [Update SLF4J version 1.7.21 -> 1.7.25](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/235)
    * When running under Java 9, log4j version 1.2.x is unable to correctly parse the "java.version" system property.
    Assuming an inccorect Java version, it proceeded to disable its MDC functionality. The slf4j-log4j12 module shipping
    in this release fixes the issue by tweaking MDC internals by reflection, allowing log4j to run under Java 9.
    * The slf4j-simple module now uses the latest reference to System.out or System.err.
    * In slf4j-simple module, added a configuration option to enable/disable caching of the System.out/err target.

- [Update Lucene version 5.3.0 -> 6.5.0](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/233)
    * [Added IndexSearcher#getQueryCache and #getQueryCachingPolicy](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6838)
    * [org.apache.lucene.search.Filter is now deprecated](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6301).
    You should use Query objects instead of Filters, and the BooleanClause.Occur.FILTER clause in order to let Lucene
    know that a Query should be used for filtering but not scoring.
    * [MatchAllDocsQuery now has a dedicated BulkScorer for better performance when used as a top-level query.]
    (http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6756)
    * [Added a IndexWriter#getFieldNames() method (experimental) to return all field names as visible from the
    IndexWriter](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-7659). This would be useful for
    IndexWriter#updateDocValues() calls, to prevent calling with non-existent docValues fields

- [Allow GranularityComparator to return static instance](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/225)
    * Implementation of [PR #193](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/193) suggests an possible improvement
    on GranularityComparator: Put the static instance on the GranularityComparator class itself, so that
    everywhere in the system that wants it could just call `GranularityComparator.getInstance()`

- [Make `TemplateDruidQuery::getMetricField` get the first field instead of any field](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/210)
    * Previously, order was by luck, now it's by the contract of `findFirst`

- [Clean up config loading and add more logs and checks]()
    * Use correct logger in `ConfigurationGraph` (was `ConfigResourceLoader`)
    * Add error / logging messages for
      - Module dependency indicator
    * Tweak loading resources debug log to read better
    * Tweak module found log to read better
    * Convert from `Resource::getFilename` to `Resource::getDescription` when reporting errors in the configuration
      graph. `getDescription` is more informative, usually holding the whole file path, rather than just the terminal
      segment / file _name_

- [Restore non-default query support in TestDruidWebservice](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/202)

- [Base TableDataSource serialization on ConcretePhysicalTable fact name](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/202)

- [CompositePhsyicalTable Core Components Refactor](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/179)
    * `TableLoader` now takes an additional constructor argument `DataSourceMetadataService` for creating tables     
    * `findMissingRequestTimeGrainIntervals` method in `PartialDataHandler` now takes `DataSourceConstraint`
    * Renamed `buildTableGroup` method to `buildDimensionSpanningTableGroup`
 
- [Restored flexibility about columns for query from DruidResponseParser](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/198)
    * Immutable schemas prevented custom query types from changing `ResultSetSchema` columns.
    * Columns are now sourced from `DruidResponseParser` and default implemented on `DruidAggregationQuery`

- [Refactor DatasourceMetaDataService to fit composite table needs](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/173)
    * `BasePhysicalTable` now stores table name as the `TableName` instead of `String`
    * `SegmentInfo` now stores dimension and metrics from segment data for constructing column to available interval map

- [QueryPlanningConstraint and DataSourceConstraint](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/169)
    * `QueryPlanningConstraint` replaces current interface of Matchers and Resolvers `DataApiRequest` and `TemplateDruidQuery` arguments during query planning
    * Modified `findMissingTimeGrainIntervals` method in `PartialDataHandler` to take a set of columns instead of `DataApiRequest` and `DruidAggregationQuery`

- [Major refactor for availability and schemas and tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/165)
    * `Schema` and `Table` became interfaces
	    * `Table` has-a `Schema`
	    * `PhysicalTable` extends `Table`, interface only supports read only operations
	* `Schema` constructed as immutable, `Column`s no longer bind to `Schema`
		* Removed addNew...Column method
	* `Schema` implementations now: `BaseSchema`, `PhysicalTableSchema`, `LogicalTableSchema`, `ResultSetSchema`
    * `DimensionLoader` uses `ConcretePhysicalTable`

    * `PhysicalTableDefinition` made some fields private, accepts iterables, returns immutable dimensions

    * `ResultSet` constructor parameter order swapped
    * `ResultSetMapper` now depends on ResultSetSchema

    * `TableDataSource` constructor arg narrows: PhysicalTable->ConcreteTable

    * `DataApiRequest` constructor arg narrows: Table->LogicalTable
	
    * `DruidQueryBuilder` now polymorphic on building data sources models from new physical tables

    * `ApiFilter` schema validation moved to DataApiRequest

    * Guava version bumped to 21.0

- [Request IDS now supports underscores.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/176)

- Added support for extensions defining new Query types
    * TestDruidWebService assumes unknown query types behave like GroupBy, TimeSeries, and TopN
    * ResultSetResponseProcessor delegates to DruidResponseProcessor to build expected query schema, 
      allowing subclasses to override and extend the schema behavior

- [Add dimension fields to fullView table format](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/155)

- [Make healthcheck filter reject message nicer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/153)
    * The previous message of `reject <url>` wasn't helpful, useful, nor very nice to users, and the message logged was
      not very useful either. The message has been made nicer (`Service is unhealthy. At least 1 healthcheck is
      failing`), and the log has been made better as well.
- [`RequestLog` timings support the try-with-resources block](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/143)
    * A block of code can now be timed by wrapping the timed block in a try-with-resources block that 
        starts the timer. Note: This won't work when performing timings across threads, or across
        contexts. Those need to be started and stopped manually.

- [Clean up logging and responses in `DimensionCacheLoaderServlet`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/163)
    * Switched a number of `error`-level logs to `debug` level to line up with logging guidance when request failures
      were result of client error
    * Reduced some `info`-level logs down to `debug`
    * Converted to 404 when error was cause by not finding a path element

### Deprecated:

- [Remove `PhysicalTable::getTableName` to use `getName` instead](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Having more than 1 method for the same concept (ie. what's the name of this physical table) was confusing and not
      very useful.

- [Remove `PhysicalTableDictionary` dependency from `SegmentIntervalHashIdGenerator`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Constructors taking the dictionary have been deprecated, since it is not used any more

- [Add `DataSourceName` concept, removing responsibility from `TableName`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Impacts:
        - `DataSourceMetadataService` & `DataSourceMetadataLoader`
        - `ConcretePhysicalTable`

- [Deprecate old static `TableName` comparator](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/263)
    * Change to `AS_NAME_COMPARATOR`, so the old name is deprecated

- [Constrained Table Support for Table Serialization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * Deprecated static empty instance of SimplifiedIntervalList.NO_INTERVALS
    * PartialDataRequestHandler constructor using `PhysicalTableDictionary`

- [Moved UnionDataSource to support only single tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * `DataSource` deprecates getDataSources()

- [SimplifiedIntervalList::NO_INTERVALS](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * This is unsafe since it is modifiable

- [Support for Lucene 5 indexes](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/265)
    * Added lucene-backward-codecs.jar as a dependency to restore support for indexes built on earlier instances.
    * Support for indexes will only remain while the current Lucene generation supports them.  All customers should rebuild indexes on Lucene 6 to avoid later pain.

- [Refactor Physical Table Definition and Update Table Loader](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/207)
    * Deprecated `loadPhysicalTable` in `BaseTableLoader`, use `loadPhysicalTablesWithDependency` instead

- [CompositePhsyicalTable Core Components Refactor](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/179)
    * Deprecated `setAvailability` method on `BasePhysicalTable` to discourage using it for testing, should refine testing strategy to avoid it

- [`RequestLog::stopMostRecentTimer` has been deprecated](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/143)
    - This method is a part of the infrastructure to support the recently
    deprecated `RequestLog::switchTiming`.

- [LogicalMetricColumn doesn't need a 2-arg constructor](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/204)
    * It's only used in one place, and there's no real need for it because the other constructor does the same thing

- [DimensionColumn's 2-arg constructor is only used by a deprecated class](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/204)
    * When that deprecated class (`LogicalDimensionColumn`) goes away, this constructor will go away as well

### Fixed:

- [Support for Lucene 5 indexes restored](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/265)
    * Added lucene-backward-codecs.jar as a dependency to restore support for indexes built on earlier instances.

- [Specify the character encoding to support unicode characters](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/221)
    * Default character set used by the back end was mangling Unicode characters.

- [Correct empty-string behavior for druid header supplier class config](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/214)
    * Empty string would have tried to build a custom supplier. Now it doesn't.

- [Default the AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl to follow redirects](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/271)
    * It defaulted to not following redirects, and now it doesn't

- [Reenable custom query types in TestDruidWebService]()

- [Fixed Segment Metadata Loader Unconfigured Dimension Bug](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/197)
    * Immutable availability was failing when attempting to bind segment dimension columns not configured in dimension dictionary.
    * Fix to filter irrelevant column names. 

- [Major refactor for availability and schemas and tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/165)
    * Ordering of fields on serialization could be inconsistent if intermediate stages used `HashSet` or `HashMap`.
    * Several constructors switched to accept `Iterable` and return `LinkedHashSet` to emphasize importance of ordering/prevent `HashSet` intermediates which disrupt ordering.

-[Fix Lookup Dimension Serialization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/187)
    * Fix a bug where lookup dimension is serialized as dimension spec in both outer and inner query

- Correcting error message logged when no table schema match is found

- Setting readTimeout on DefaultAsyncHttpClientConfig when building AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl

    * Removed deprecated `PhysicalTableDefinition` constructor that takes an `ZonlessTimeGrain`, use `ZonedTimeGrain` instead
    * Removed `buildPhysicalTable` in `BaseTableLoader`, building table logic is pushed into `PhysicalTableDefinition`

- [Moved UnionDataSource to support only single tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/262/files)
    * `DataSource` no longer accepts Set<Table> constructor

    * Removed deprecated method `findMissingRequestTimeGrainIntervals` from `PartialDataHandler`
    * Removed `permissive_column_availability_enabled` feature flag support and corresponding functionality in `PartialDataHandler`, permissive availability will be a table configuration
    * Removed `getIntersectSubintervalsForColumns` and `getUnionSubintervalsForColumns` from `PartialDataHandler` since the logic is pushed into `Availability` now
    * Removed `getIntervalsByColumnName`, `resetColumns` and `hasLogicalMapping` methods in `PhysicalTable` since no longer needed with the availability structure
    * Removed `getAvailability` method on `PartialDataHandler` since the logic is pushed into `Availability`
    * Removed `SegmentMetadataLoader` and corresponding tests class which is deprecated in both fili and the corresponding endpoint in druid, use `DataSourceMetadataLoader` instead
    * Removed `SegmentMetadataLoaderHealthCheck` and `SegmentMetadataLoaderHealthCheckSpec` classes since `SegmentMetadataLoader` is not longer available

- [Major refactor for availability and schemas and tables](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/165)
    *  Removed `ZonedSchema` (all methods moved to child class ResultSetSchema)

    * `PhysicalTable` no longer supports mutable availability
	    * Removed addColumn, removeColumn, getWorkingIntervals, resetColumns, commit
		* resetColumns moved to BasePhysicalTable
		* Other mutators no longer exist, availability is immutable
		* getAvailableIntervals removed (availability.getAvailableIntervals replaces)	

    * `DruidResponseParser` buildSchema removed, work moved to ResultSetSchema constructor

    * `BaseTableLoader` removed redundant buildLogicalTable methods


v0.7.36 - 2017/01/30
--------------------

This release is a mix of fixes, upgrades, and interface clean-up. The general themes for the changes are around metric
configuration, logging and timing, and adding support for tagging dimension fields. Here are some of the highlights, but
take a look in the lower sections for more details.

Fixes:
- Deadlock in `LuceneSearchProvider`
- CORS support when using the `RoleBasedAuthFilter`

New Capabilities & Enhancements:
- Dimension field tagging
- Controls around max size of Druid response to cache
- Logging and timing enhancements

Deprecations / Removals:
- `RequestLog::switchTiming` is deprecated due to it's difficulty to use correctly
- Metric configuration has a number of deprecations as part of the effort to make configuration easier and less complex

Changes:
- There was a major overhaul of Fili's dependencies to upgrade their versions


### Added:

- [Dimension Field Tagging and Dynamic Dimension Field Serilization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/137)
    * Added a new module `fili-navi` for components added to support for Navi
    * Added `TaggedDimensionField` and related components in `fili-navi`

- [Ability to prevent caching of Druid responses larger than the maximum size supported by the cache](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/93)
    * Supported for both Cache v1 and V2
    * Controlled with `bard__druid_max_response_length_to_cache` setting
    * Default value is `MAX_LONG`, so no cache prevention will happen by default

- [Log a warning if `SegmentMetadataLoader` tries to load empty segment metadata](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/113)
    * While not an error condition (eg. configuration migration), it's unusual, and likely shouldn't stay this way long

- [More descriptive log message when no physical table found due to schema mismatch](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/113)
    * Previous log message was user-facing only, and not as helpful as it could have been

- [Logs more finegrained timings of the request processing workflow](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/110)

- [Added RegisteredLookupDimension and RegisteredLookupExtractionFunction](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/132)
    * This enables supporting Druid's most recent evolution of the Query Time Lookup feature

- [`FilteredAggregationMaker`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/107)
    * This version is rudimentary. See [issue 120](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issue/120) for future plans.

- [Support for Druid's `LinearShardSpec` metadata type](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/107)

- [Added MetricField accessor to the interface of LogicalMetric](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/124)
    * Previously accessing the metric field involved using three method calls

- [Ability for `ClassScanner` to instantiate arrays](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/107)
    * This allows for more robust testing of classes that make use of arrays in their constructor parameters

- [Module load test code](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/122)
    * Code to automatically test module is correctly configured.

- [Comprehensive tests for `MetricMaker` field coercion methods](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/128)

### Changed:

- [The druid query posting timer has been removed](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/141)
    * There wasn't really a good way of stopping timing only the posting itself. Since the timer is 
       probably not that useful, it has been removed. 

- [Dimension Field Tagging and Dynamic Dimension Field Serilization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/137)
    * Changed `fili-core` dimension endpoint `DimensionField` serialization strategy from hard coded static attributes
      to dynamic serialization based on `jackson` serializer

- [MetricMaker cleanup and simplification](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/127)
    * Simplified raw aggregation makers
    * `ConstantMaker` now throws an `IllegalArgumentException` wrapping the raw NumberFormatException on a bad argument
    * `FilteredAggregation` no longer requires a metric name to be passed in. (Aggregation field name is used)
    * `FilteredAggregationMaker` now accepts a metric to the 'make' method instead of binding at construction time.
    * `ArithmeticAggregationMaker` default now uses `NoOpResultSetMapper` instead of rounding mapper. (breaking change)
    * `FilteredAggregationMaker`, `SketchSetOperationMaker` members are now private

- [Used Metric Field accessor to simplify maker code](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/124)
    * Using metric field accessor simplifies and enables streaminess in maker code

- [Fili's name for a PhysicalTable is decoupled from the name of the associated table in Druid](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/123)

- [No match found due to schema mismatch now a `500 Internal Server Error` response instead of a `400 Bad Request` response](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/113)
    * This should never be a user fault, since that check is much earlier

- [Make `SegmentMetadata::equals` `null`-safe](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/113)
    * It was not properly checking for `null` before and could have exploded

- [Default DimensionColumn name to use apiName instead of physicalName](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/115)
    * Change `DimensionColumn.java` to use dimension api name instead of physical name as its name
    * Modified files dependent on `DimensionColumn.java` and corresponding tests according to the above change

- [`NoOpResultSetMapper` now runs in constant time and space.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/119)

- [Remove restriction for single physical dimension to multiple lookup dimensions](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/112)
    * Change physical dimension name to logical dimension name mapping into `Map<String, Set<String>>` instead of
      `Map<String, String>` in `PhysicalTable.java`

- [SegmentMetadataLoader include provided request headers](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/106)
    * `SegmentMetadataLoader` sends requests with the provided request headers in `AsyncDruidWebservice` now
    * Refactored `AsyncDruidWebserviceSpec` test and added test for checking `getJsonData` includes request headers too

- [Include physical table name in warning log message for logicalToPhysical mapping](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/94)
    * Without this name, it's hard to know what table seems to be misconfigured.

- [`ResponseValidationException` uses `Response.StatusType` rather than `Response.Status`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/96)
    * `Response.StatusType` is the interface that `Response.Status` implements.
    * This will have no impact on current code in Fili that uses `ResponseValidationException`, and it allows customers
      to inject http codes not included in `Response.Status`.
         
- [Removed "provided" modifier for SLF4J and Logback dependencies in the Wikipedia example](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/102)

- [Updated dependencies](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/103)

    Unless otherwise noted, all dependency upgrades are for general stability and performance improvement. The called-
    out changes are only those that are likely of interest to Fili. Any dependency upgrade for which a changelog could
    not be found has not been linked to one, otherwise all other upgrades include a link to the relevant changelog.

    WARNING: There is a known dependency conflict between apache commons configuration 1.6 and 1.10. If after upgrading
    to the latest Fili, your tests begin to fail with `NoClassDefFoundExceptions`, it is likely that you are explicitly
    depending on the apache commons configuration 1.6. Removing that dependency or upgrading it to 1.10 should fix the
    issue.

### Deprecated:

- [Deprecated DefaultingDictionary usage in DefaultingVolatileIntervalsService](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/259)

- [`RequestLog::switchTiming` has been deprecated](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/141)
    - `RequestLog::switchTiming` is very context-dependent, and therefore brittle. In particular, adding any additional
      timers inside code called by a timed block may result in the original timer not stopping properly. All usages of
      `switchTiming` should be replaced with explicit calls to `RequestLog::startTiming` and `RequestLog::stopTiming`.

- [Dimension Field Tagging and Dynamic Dimension Field Serilization](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/137)
    * Deprecated `DimensionsServlet::getDimensionFieldListSummaryView` and `DimensionsServlet::getDimensionFieldSummaryView`
      since there is no need for it anymore due to the change in serialization of `DimensionField`

- [Default DimensionColumn name to use apiName instead of physicalName](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/115)
    * Deprecated `TableUtils::getColumnNames(DataApiRequest, DruidAggregationQuery, PhysicalTable)` returning dimension
      physical name, in favor of `TableUtils::getColumnNames(DataApiRequest, DruidAggregationQuery)` returning dimension
      api name
    * Deprecated `DimensionColumn::DimensionColumn addNewDimensionColumn(Schema, Dimension, PhysicalTable)` in favor of
      `DimensionColumn::DimensionColumn addNewDimensionColumn(Schema, Dimension)` which uses api name instead of
      physical name as column identifier for columns
    * Deprecated `LogicalDimensionColumn` in favor of `DimensionColumn` since `DimensionColumn` stores api name instead
      of physical name now, so `LogicalDimensionColumn` is no longer needed

- [Moved to static implementations for numeric and sketch coercion helper methods](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/128)
    * `MetricMaker.getSketchField(String fieldName)` rather use `MetricMaker.getSketchField(MetricField field)`
    * `MetricMaker.getNumericField(String fieldName)` rather use `MetricMaker.getNumericField(MetricField field)`

- [MetricMaker cleanup and simplification](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/127)
    * `AggregationAverageMaker` deprecated conversion method required by deprecated sketch library

- [Metric configuration deprecations](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/124)
    * Deprecated superfluous constructor of `FilteredAggregator` with superfluous argument 
    * Deprecated MetricMaker utility method in favor of using new field accessor on Metric

- [Deprecated MetricMaker.getDependentQuery lookup method in favor of simpler direct access](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/124)

### Fixed:

- [Fixes a potential deadlock](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/116)
    * There is a chance the `LuceneSearchProvider` will deadlock if one thread is attempting to read a dimension for the
      first time while another is  attempting to load it:
        - Thread A is pushing in new dimension data. It invokes `refreshIndex`, and acquires the write lock.
        - Thread B is reading dimension data. It invokes `getResultsPage`, and then `initializeIndexSearcher`, then
          `reopenIndexSearcher`. It hits the write lock (acquired by Thread A) and blocks.
        - At the end of its computation of `refreshIndex`, Thread A attempts to invoke `reopenIndexSearcher`. However,
          `reopenIndexSearcher` is `synchronized`, and Thread B is already invoking it.
        - To fix the resulting deadlock, `reopenIndexSearcher` is no longer synchronized. Since threads need to acquire
          a write lock before doing anything else anyway, the method is still effectively  synchronized.

- [Fix and refactor role based filter to allow CORS](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/99)
    * Fix `RoleBasedAuthFilter` to bypass `OPTIONS` request for CORS
    * Discovered a bug where `user_roles` is declared but unset still reads as a list with empty string (included a temporary fix by commenting the variable declaration)
    * Refactored `RoleBasedAuthFilter` and `RoleBasedAuthFilterSpec` for better testing

- [Added missing coverage for `ThetaSketchEstimate` unwrapping in `MetricMaker.getSketchField`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/128) 

- [`DataSource::getNames` now returns Fili identifiers, not fact store identifiers](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/125/files)

- [Made a few injection points not useless](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/98)
    * Template types don't get the same subclass goodness that method invocation and dependencies get, so this method
      did not allow returning a subclass of `DruidQueryBuilder` or of `DruidResponseParser`.

- [Made now required constructor for ArithmeticMaker with rounding public](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/148)

### Removed:

- [Removed invalid constructor from SketchRoundUpMappepr](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/148) 


v0.6.29 - 2016/11/16
--------------------

This release is focused on general stability, with a number of bugs fixed, and also adds a few small new capabilities
and enhancements. Here are some of the highlights, but take a look in the lower sections for more details.

Fixes:
- Dimension keys are now properly case-sensitive (
  - ***Because this is a breaking change, the fix has been wrapped in a feature flag. For now, this defaults to the
    existing broken behavior, but this will change in a future version, and eventually the fix will be permanent.***
- `all`-grain queries are no longer split
- Closed a race condition in the `LuceneSearchProvider` where readers would get an error if an update was in progress
- Correctly interpreting List-type configs from the Environment tier as a true `List`
- Stopped recording synchronous requests in the `ApiJobStore`, which is only intended to hold async requests

New Capabilities & Enhancements:
- Customizable logging format
- X-Request-Id header support, letting clients set a request ID that will be included in the Druid query
- Support for Druid's `In` filter
- Native support for building `DimensionRow`s from AVRO files
- Ability to set headers on Druid requests, letting Fili talk to a secure Druid
- Better error messaging when things go wrong
- Better ability to use custom Druid query types

### Added:

- [Added Dimension Value implementation for PartitionTableDefinition]
    * Added `DimensionIdFilter` implementation of  `DataSourceFilter`
    * Created `DimensionListPartitionTableDefinition` 

- [Added 'hasAnyRows' to SearchProvider interface](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/259)
    * Has Any Rows allows implementations to optimize queries which only need to identify existence of matches

- [Customize Logging Format in RequestLog](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/81)

- [Can Populate Dimension Rows from an AVRO file](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/86)
    * Added `AvroDimensionRowParser` that parses an AVRO data file into `DimensionRow`s after validating the AVRO schema.
    * Added a functional Interface `DimensionFieldMapper` that maps field name.

- [Support for Druid's In Filter](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/64)
    * The in-filter only works with Druid versions 0.9.0 and up.

- [Support for X-Request-ID](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/68)

- [Documentation for topN](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/43)

- [Adding slice availability to slices endpoint](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/51)
    * Slice availability can be used to debug availability issues on Physical tables

- [Ability to set headers for requests to Druid](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/62)
      * The `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl` now accepts a `Supplier<Map<String, String>>` argument which specifies the headers 
        to add to the Druid data requests. This feature is made configurable through `SystemConfig` in the 
        `AbstractBinderFactory`.

### Changed:

- [Error messages generated during response processing include the request id.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/78)

- [`DimensionStoreKeyUtils` now supports case sensitive row and column keys](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/90)
    * Wrapped this config in a feature flag `case_sensitive_keys_enabled` which is set to `false` by default for
      backwards compatibility. This flag will be set to `true` in future versions.

- [The `getGrainMap` method in `StandardGranularityParser` class is renamed to `getDefaultGrainMap` and is made public static.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/88)
    * Created new class `GranularityDictionary` and bind getGranularityDictionary to it

- [`PhysicalTable` now uses `getAvailableIntervals` internally rather than directly referencing its intervals](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/79)

- [CSV attachment name for multi-interval request now contain '__' instead of ','](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/76)
    * This change is made to allow running multi-api request with csv format using chrome browser.

- [Improves error messages when querying Druid goes wrong](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/61)
    * The `ResponseException` now includes a message that prints the `ResponseException`'s internal state 
        (i.e. the druid query and response code) using the error messages 
        `ErrorMessageFormat::FAILED_TO_SEND_QUERY_TO_DRUID` and `ErrorMessageFormat::ERROR_FROM_DRUID`
    * The druid query and status code, reason and response body are now logged at the error level in the 
      failure and error callbacks in `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl`  
          
- [Fili now supports custom Druid query types](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/57)
    * `QueryType` has been turned into an interface, backed by an enum `DefaultQueryType`.
        - The default implementations of `DruidResponseParser` `DruidQueryBuilder`, `WeightEvaluationQuery` and
          `TestDruidWebService` only support `DefaultQueryType`.
    * `DruidResponseParser` is now injectable by overriding `AbstractBinderFactory::buildDruidResponseParser` method.
    * `DruidQueryBuilder` is now injectable by overriding `AbstractBinderFactory::buildDruidQueryBuilder` method.

- [Updated commons-collections4 dependency from 4.0 to 4.1 to address a security vulnerability in the library.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/52)
    * For details see: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/security-reports.html#Apache_Commons_Collections_Security_Vulnerabilities
    * It should be noted that Fili does not make use of any the serialization/deserialization capabilities of any classes
      in the functor package, so the security vulnerability does not affect Fili.

- Clean up build plugins
    * Move some plugin configs up to `pluginManagement`
    * Make `fili-core` publish test javadocs
    * Default source plugin to target `jar-no-fork` instead of `jar`
    * Default javadoc plugin to target `javadoc-no-fork` as well as `jar`
    * Move some versions up to `pluginManagement`
    * Remove overly (and un-usedly) specified options in surfire plugin configs
    * Make all projects pull in the `source` plugin

- Corrected bug with Fili sub-module dependency specification
    * Dependency versions are now set via a fixed property at deploy time, rather than relying on `project.version`

- Cleaned up dependencies in pom files
    * Moved version management of dependencies up to the parent Pom's dependency management section
    * Cleaned up the parent Pom's dependency section to only be those dependencies that truly _every_ sub-project should 
      depend on.
    * Cleaned up sub-project Pom dependency sections to handle and better use the dependencies the parent Pom provides 

### Deprecated:

- [`DimensionStoreKeyUtils` now supports case sensitive row and column keys](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/90)
    - Case insensitive row and column keys will be deprecated going forward.
    - ***Because this is a breaking change, the fix has been wrapped in a feature flag. For now, this defaults to the
        existing broken behavior, but this will change in a future version, and eventually the fix will be permanent.***
        - The feature flag for this is `bard__case_sensitive_keys_enabled`

- [All constructors of `ResponseException` that do not take an `ObjectWriter`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/70)
    * An `ObjectWriter` is required in order to ensure that the exception correctly serializes its associated Druid query

### Fixed:

- [Environment comma separated list variables are now correctly pulled in as a list](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/82)
    * Before it was pulled in as a single sting containing commas, now environment variables are pulled in the same way
      as the properties files
    * Added test to test comma separated list environment variables when `FILI_TEST_LIST` environment variable exists

- [Druid queries are now serialized correctly when logging `ResponseExceptions`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/70)

- [Disable Query split for "all" grain ](https:://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/75)
    * Before, if we requested "all" grain with multiple intervals, the `SplitQueryRequestHandler` would incorrectly
      split the query and we would get multiple buckets in the output. Now, the query split is disabled for "all" grain
      and we correctly get only one bucket in the response.

- [Fixed typo emit -> omit in Utils.java omitField()](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/68)

- [Adds read locking to all attempts to read the Lucene index](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/52)
    * Before, if Fili attempted to read from the Lucene indices (i.e. processing a query with filters) while loading
      dimension indices, the request would fail and we would get a `LuceneIndexReaderAlreadyClosedException`. Now, the 
      read locks should ensure that the query processing will wait until indexing completes (and vice versa).

- [Fixes a bug where job metadata was being stored in the `ApiJobStore` even when the results came back synchronously](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/49)
    * The workflow that updates the job's metadata with `success` was running even when the query was synchronous. That 
      update also caused the ticket to be stored in the `ApiJobStore`.
    * The delay operator didn't stop the "update" workflow from executing because it viewed an `Observable::onCompleted`
      call as a message for the purpose of the delay. Since the two observables that that the metadata update gated on 
      are empty when the query is synchronous, the "update metadata" workflow was being triggered every time.
    * The delay operator was replaced by `zipWith` as a gating mechanism.
    
- [#45, removing sorting from weight check queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/46)

- [`JsonSlurper` can now handle sorting lists with mixed-type entries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/58)
    * even if the list starts with a string, number, or boolean
  
- [Broken segment metadata with Druid v0.9.1](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/63)
    * Made `NumberedShardSpec` ignore unexpected properties during deserialization
    * Added tests to `DataSourceMetadataLoaderSpec` to test the v.0.9.1 optional field `shardSpec.partitionDimensions`
      on segment info JSON.


v0.1.x - 2016/09/23
-------------------

This release focuses on stabilization, especially of the Query Time Lookup (QTL) capabilities, and the Async API and
Jobs resource. Here are the highlights of what's in this release:

- A bugfix for the `DruidDimensionLoader`
- A new default `DimensionLoader`
- A bunch more tests and test upgrades
- Filtering and pagination on the Jobs resource
- A `userId` field for default Job resource representations
- Package cleanup for the jobs-related classes
 
### Added:

- [`always` keyword for the `asyncAfter` parameter now guarantees that a query will be asynchronous](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)

- [A test implementation of the `AsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`: `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * Identical to the `DefaultAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`, except that it includes hooks to allow outside forces (i.e.
    Specifications) to add additional subscribers to each workflow.

- [Functional tests for Asynchronous queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * Jobs endpoint now supports filters

- [Enrich the ApiJobStore interface] (https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/23)
  * `ApiJobStore` interface now supports filtering `JobRows` in the store
  * Added support for filtering JobRows in `HashJobStore`
  * Added `JobRowFilter` to hold filter information

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Added two tests `LookupDimensionFilteringDataServletSpec` and `LookupDimensionGroupingDataServletSpec` to test QTL 
    functionality

- [Lookup Dimension Serializer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/31)
  * Created `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` serializer for `LookupDimension`
  * Created corresponding tests for `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpec` in `LookupDimensionToDimensionSpecSpec`

### Deprecated:

- [Allow configurable headers for Druid data requests](https:://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/62)
  * Deprecated `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl(DruidServiceConfig, ObjectMapper)` and
    `AsyncDruidWebServiceImpl(DruidServiceConfig, AsyncHttpClient, ObjectMapper)` because we added new construstructors
    that take a `Supplier` argument for Druid data request headers.

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Deprecated `KeyValueDimensionLoader`, in favor of `TypeAwareDimensionLoader`

### Changed:

- Removed `physicalName` lookup for metrics in `TableUtils::getColumnNames` to remove spurious warnings
     * Metrics are not mapped like dimensions are. Dimensions are aliased per physical table and metrics are aliazed per logical table.
     * Logical metric is mapped with one or many physical metrics. Same look up logic for dimension and metrics doesn't make sense.

#### Jobs:

- [HashPreResponseStore moved to `test` root directory.](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * The `HashPreResponseStore` is really intended only for testing, and does not have capabilities (i.e. TTL) that are
    needed for production.

- [The `TestBinderFactory` now uses the `TestAsynchronousWorkflowsBuilder`](http://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * This allows the asynchronous functional tests to add countdown latches to the workflows where necessary, allowing
    for thread-safe tests.

- [Removed `JobsApiRequest::handleBroadcastChannelNotification`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/39)
  * That logic does not really belong in the `JobsApiRequest` (which is responsible for modeling a response, not 
    processing it), and has been consolidated into the `JobsServlet`.

- [ISSUE-17](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/issues/17) [Added pagination parameters to `PreResponse`](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)
  * Updated `JobsServlet::handlePreResponseWithError` to update `ResultSet` object with pagination parameters

- [Enrich jobs endpoint with filtering functionality](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/26)
  * The default job payload generated by `DefaultJobPayloadBuilder` now has a `userId`

- [Removed timing component in JobsApiRequestSpec](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/27)
  * Rather than setting an async timeout, and then sleeping, `JobsApiRequestSpec::handleBroadcastChannelNotification` 
    returns an empty Observable if a timeout occurs before the notification is received now verifies that the Observable
    returned terminates without sending any messages.

- [Reorganizes asynchronous package structure](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/19)
  * The `jobs` package is renamed to `async` and split into the following subpackages:
    - `broadcastchannels` - Everything dealing with broadcast channels
    - `jobs` - Everything related to `jobs`, broken into subpackages
      * `jobrows` - Everything related to the content of the job metadata
      * `payloads` - Everything related to building the version of the job metadata to send to the user
      * `stores` - Everything related to the databases for job data
    - `preresponses` - Everything related to `PreResponses`, broken into subpackages
      * `stores` - Everything related to the the databases for PreResponse data
    - `workflows` - Everything related to the asynchronous workflow

#### Query Time Lookup (QTL)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * `AbstractBinderFactory` now uses `TypeAwareDimensionLoader` instead of `KeyValueStoreDimensionLoader`

- [Fix Dimension Serialization Problem with Nested Queries](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/15)
  * Modified `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec` serializer to serialize Dimension to apiName if it's not in the 
    inner-most query
  * Added `Util::hasInnerQuery` helper in serializer package to determine if query is the inner most query or not
  * Added tests for `DimensionToDefaultDimensionSpec`
    
#### General:

- [Preserve collection order of dimensions, dimension fields and metrics](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/25)
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensions` now returns a `LinkedHashSet`
  * `DataApiRequest::generateDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>`
  * `DataApiRequest::withPerDimensionFields` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` as its second argument.
  * `DataApiRequest::getDimensionFields` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `Response::Response` now takes a `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>` as
    its second  and third arguments.
  * `ResponseContext::dimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now takes a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`
  * `ResponseContext::getDimensionToDimensionFieldMap` now returns a `LinkedHashMap<Dimension, LinkedHashSet<DimensionField>>>`

- [`TestDruidWebService::jsonResponse` is now a `Producer<String>` Producer](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/35)

- [QueryTimeLookup Functionality Testing](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/34)
  * Modified some testing resources (PETS table and corresponding dimensions) to allow better testing on `LookupDimension`s

- [Memoize generated values during recursive class-scan class construction](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/29)

### Fixed:

- [Fixing the case when the security context is not complete](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/67)
  * Check for nulls in the `DefaultJobRowBuilder.userIdExtractor` function.

- [`DruidDimensionsLoader` doesn't set the dimension's lastUpdated date](https://github.com/yahoo/fili/pull/24)
  * `DruidDimensionsLoader` now properly sets the `lastUpdated` field after it finished processing the Druid response
